## Welcome & Objective

Welcome to my Github repository that is designed to give you an overview on my skill sets, especially in: 

- the exposure of working with **data variety** (e.g. unstructured & structured data), 
- the comfortability of applying **quantitative techniques** (e.g. ML/DL/Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Probability), and 
- the level of **data literacy** (e.g. thought process / assumption making).

NOTE: This repository is ONLY designed for Job Application purposes.

## Quick Start:

The following 4 Notebooks aim to give an overview on general used cases and each presentation is a standalone little project with its specific objective. Do go into specific folders for more Deep Learning models and specific areas (e.g. Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio). :

1. [Cifar-10 Image Classification via CNN](https://github.com/kplai2020/application/blob/main/image_cnn/image_cnn.ipynb)
2. [IMDB Sentiment Classification via LSTM (Hyperparameters Tuning)](https://github.com/kplai2020/application/blob/main/nlp_lstm.ipynb)
3. [Freesound-Audio-Tagging Audio Generation via GANs](https://github.com/kplai2020/application/blob/main/audio_gan/audio_gan.ipynb)
4. [Movie Recommender](https://github.com/kplai2020/application/blob/main/recommendation_system.ipynb)

Computer Vision Folder:
1. [EfficientNetB3 - Image Classification](https://github.com/kplai2020/application/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Image_Classification_EfficientNetB3.ipynb)
2. [YOLOv3 - Object Detection](https://github.com/kplai2020/application/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Object_Detection_YOLOv3.ipynb)
3. [Detectron2 - Instance & Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/kplai2020/application/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/Instance_Semantic_Segmentation_Detectron2.ipynb)
