## Welcome & Objective

Welcome to my private repository on Github and once again, thank you for considering me. This repository aims to give you an overview on my skill sets, especially in the exposure of working with data variety, the comfortability of applying quantitative techniques (e.g. ML/DL/Applied Maths, Stats, Prob), and the level of data literacy (e.g. thought process / assumption making).


## Quick Start:

This repository comes with 2 Notebooks and each presentation is a standalone little project, which is designed based on:

1. The unstructured Dataset: Image: Cifar-10 Image Classification via CNN 
2. The structured Dataset: Movie Recommender
