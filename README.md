## Welcome & Objective

Welcome to my repository on Github and once again, thank you for considering me. This repository aims to give you an overview on my skill sets, especially in the exposure of working with **data variety** (e.g. unstructured & structured data), the comfortability of applying **quantitative techniques** (e.g. ML/DL/Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Probability), and the level of **data literacy** (e.g. thought process / assumption making).

NOTE: This repository is designed for Job Application.

## Quick Start:

4 Notebooks are provided in this repository and each presentation is a standalone little project with its specific objective to be shared. :

1. Cifar-10 Image Classification via CNN
2. IMDB Sentiment Classification via LSTM (Hyperparameters Tuning)
3. Audio Generation via Generative Adversarial Netwoks (GANs)
4. Movie Recommender
