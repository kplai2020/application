## Welcome & Objective

Welcome to my repository on Github which is designed to give you an overview on my skill sets, especially in: 

- the exposure of working with **data variety** (e.g. unstructured & structured data), 
- the comfortability of applying **quantitative techniques** (e.g. ML/DL/Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Probability), and 
- the level of **data literacy** (e.g. thought process / assumption making).

NOTE: This repository is ONLY designed for Job Application purposes.

## Quick Start:

The following 4 Notebooks aim to give an overview on general used cases and each presentation is a standalone little project with its specific objective. :

1. Cifar-10 Image Classification via CNN
2. IMDB Sentiment Classification via LSTM (Hyperparameters Tuning)
3. Freesound-Audio-Tagging Audio Generation via GANs
4. Movie Recommender

Do go into specific folders for more specific areas (e.g. Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio) and Deep Learning models. :

1. Computer Vision Folders:
- EfficientNetB3 - Image Classification
  - YOLOv3 - Object Detection
  - Detectron2 - Instance & Semantic Segmentation
